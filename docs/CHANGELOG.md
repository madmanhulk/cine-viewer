## [1.1.6] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Enhanced Logging System**: Comprehensive admin logging improvements
  - Periodic memory usage logging (every 30 seconds by default)
  - Memory usage displayed in MB and percentage of system memory
  - Configurable logging interval for debugging purposes
- **Real Client IP Detection**: Fixed client IP logging for Docker/proxy environments
  - Added `get_client_ip()` function to detect real client IP addresses
  - Checks X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers
  - Properly logs actual host IP instead of Docker bridge IP (172.x.x.x)
  - Works correctly behind reverse proxies (Nginx, Apache, etc.)

### Fixed
- Suppressed NumPy runtime warnings (divide by zero, invalid values)
  - Added warning filters for RuntimeWarning
  - Configured NumPy error handling to ignore divide/invalid operations
  - Cleaner logs without harmless mathematical warnings

### Technical
- Added `warnings` module import for filtering specific warning types
- Implemented `log_memory_usage()` daemon thread for continuous monitoring
- Enhanced `track_client()` to use real IP detection
- Updated all client IP references to use `get_client_ip()` helper function

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Contrast Ratio Calculation**: Added Rec. 709 standard luminance-based contrast ratio measurement
  - Displays as whole number ratio (e.g., "255:1")
  - Uses 99th/1st percentile to avoid outlier pixels
  - Applied WCAG formula for accurate perceptual contrast
- **UI Spacing Improvements**: Enhanced sidebar spacing between control groups
  - Added visual separation between "Open Image" and overlay controls
  - Added separation between "Thirds Grid" and "False Color"
  - Improved visual hierarchy without adding divider lines

### Fixed
- Contrast ratio now rounds to nearest whole number (no decimals)

### Documentation
- Updated README with all v1.1 features and improvements
- Comprehensive Docker Deployment guide overhaul
- Added automated update scheduling documentation for Portainer

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Color Palette Extraction**: AI-powered 8-color dominant color extraction
  - K-means clustering with enhanced feature space (RGB + saturation + brightness)
  - Saturation-weighted sampling (70% saturation bias, 30% uniform)
  - Analyzes 50,000 pixels for accurate representation
  - Brightness-ordered display (lightest to darkest)
  - Click-to-copy hex codes with visual feedback
  - Hover to display hex values overlaid on swatches
  - Vertical layout positioned left of image viewer
  - Smart "interest score" ranking balancing frequency and vibrancy

### Changed
- Upgraded color extraction algorithm for better diversity
  - Increased sampling from 10,000 to 50,000 pixels
  - Enhanced k-means iterations (n_init=20, max_iter=500)
  - Improved perceptual color grouping
- UI refinements for equal padding throughout layout
- Removed padding inconsistencies in image container

### Technical
- Added scikit-learn dependency for machine learning-based clustering
- Implemented saturation calculation for pixel weighting
- Optimized memory usage during color extraction

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27

## [0.29.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- Vectorscope pixel highlighting on mouse hover
- Real-time pixel color tracking with UV coordinates
- Enhanced vectorscope visualization with highlighted points

### Technical
- Added `/api/pixel-color` endpoint for real-time color analysis
- Implemented throttled mouse tracking (50ms throttle)
- Client-side coordinate mapping for canvas precision
